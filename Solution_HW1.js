Simply create some variables using const and let. Give at least 3 strings and 3 numbers. In the case of let display that you understand how to reassign variables by reusing the same variable identifier (name).

Demonstrate your understanding of comparison operators by applying !== and ===, which means  'is equal to.'
👆🏾That's b/c for a boolean, it must be all lowercase. true instead of True. 

With the capitalized version, we are looking for a variable named True 
(uppercase 'T' - which would be a terrible name for a variable, but technically 🙆🏾‍♂️). 
This has not ever been defined is not in memory, so we get the error - ReferenceError

et car = 'Mercedes';
let pants = 'Calvin Klein';
let sunglasses = 'Ray Bans';
const moneyWithoutClass = True;
const inStyle = True;
const babeMagnet = False;

car = 'Porsche';
suit = 'Armani';
sunglasses = 'Versace'

moneyWithoutClass === inStyle;
inStyle !== babeMagnet;
