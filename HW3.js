/*Create an object literal. This object literal could be named 
numberSummerMachine .
numberSummerMachine should have ðŸ”‘s for startingNumber and 
endingNumber . numberSummerMachine should have a method - 
perhaps called sumDaNumbers . This method should use the 
current value of its startingNumber and endingNumber and 
it should use looping (either while or for ) to return 
the 'sum of the numbers.' 

Note that `startingNumber` and `endingNumber` can be set as 
whatever values you want, but it's just done 'manually.' 

HINT: You will need to use this inside of the function to 
access the properly scoped ðŸ”‘
