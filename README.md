## This a second header.

This is unformatted text, or in other words: boring.

_This text is in italics, which is designed to make you, the writer, feel important._

**THIS text is in bold. Which is designed to tell the reader that it IS important, no matter who the writer is.**

**_This text is in both. I think using both italics AND bold is well...bold. Just saying._**

~~This text is rendered with strikethrough. I see this used on tech blogs with great effect.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\* right into **your paragraph.**  Just saying.
